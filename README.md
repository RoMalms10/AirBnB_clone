## Airbnb Clone - Command Interpreter Project Description
### This is a multi-part project which will result in a complete clone of the Airbnb website, both front-end and back-end. For this part of the project using Python programming language, we will build a command interpreter for the cloned web app. A command interpreter is very similar to the BASH shell, but designed for a specific use case.
## How to start the interpreter
### From the command line run ./console.py or echo "help" | ./console.py
## Usage
### Included with the basic interpreter are console commands EOF, quit, and help. EOF and quit are used to exit the interpreter and help is used to lookup what a command does or to print a list of included commands.
## Examples of Usage
